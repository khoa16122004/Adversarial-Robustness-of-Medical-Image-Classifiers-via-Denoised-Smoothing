# Adversarial Robustness of Medical Image Classifiers via Denoised Smoothing

This repository implements robust medical image classification using denoised smoothing techniques, combining approaches from certified robustness and black-box defense methods.

## Overview

Medical image classification systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise their reliability in clinical settings. This project implements defense mechanisms using denoised smoothing combined with both first-order (FO) and zero-order (ZO) optimization approaches to create robust medical image classifiers.

## Reference Implementations

This work builds upon:
1. [Microsoft's Denoised Smoothing](https://github.com/microsoft/denoised-smoothing) - For certified robustness via denoising
2. [Black-box Defense](https://github.com/damon-demon/Black-Box-Defense) - For optimization techniques
3. [Adversarial Libraries](https://github.com/jeromerony/adversarial-library): for create adversarial examples

## Datasets

The project utilizes two medical imaging datasets:

1. [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)
   - Purpose: Brain tumor classification from MRI scans
   - Classes: Multiple tumor types and normal tissue

2. [Sipakmed Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prahladmehandiratta/cervical-cancer-largest-dataset-sipakmed)
   - Purpose: Cervical cancer cell classification
   - Scope: Largest available cervical cytology dataset
